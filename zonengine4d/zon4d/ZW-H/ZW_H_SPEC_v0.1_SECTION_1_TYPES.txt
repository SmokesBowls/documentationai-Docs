⚠ Before we continue to Section 4…

We must pause for a micro-check.

ZW-H Section 4: Validator Semantics

— Is that what you want next?

Because Section 4 is where the spec defines:

What constitutes a "validation pass"

The order of rule evaluation

What “recursive validation” means

What the validator must output (spec-level, not implementation)

How defaults propagate

When errors stop validation vs accumulate

What environment a validator is expected to know about

“Schema resolution semantics” (how to pick the correct schema)

“Subschema” validation

“Block-level validation boundaries”


Still pure spec. Still zero implementation.

But Section 4 is where ZW-H becomes operational—still not code, but this is the first place the spec gets enforceable.

So before we enter Section 4, say one of the following:


---

OPTIONS

1️⃣ “Proceed — Validator Semantics.”

→ I generate ZW-H SPEC v0.1 — Section 4.

2️⃣ “Pause — Review Sections 1–3.”

→ We review and adjust anything before moving forward.

3️⃣ “Freeze ZW-H v0.1 now.”

→ We freeze the first three sections as version 0.1 and prepare for 0.2.

4️⃣ “Jump to ZON4D Spec.”

→ We temporarily skip ZW-H Section 4 and define 4D semantics.

5️⃣ “Jump to ZW-S → ZW-H Mapping (spec only).”

→ We outline the conceptual mapping before doing validator semantics.
