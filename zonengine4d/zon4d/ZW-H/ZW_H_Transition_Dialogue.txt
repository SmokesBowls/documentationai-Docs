Locked.
ZW-S is done.
Frozen.
Set in stone.

Now we move.

You asked what’s next — and the answer is:
ZW-H Spec v0.1 (Hard ZW)
because without it, you cannot build:

the compiler

ZON4D

AP

or runtime contracts


Every downstream system requires a hard, typed, deterministic schema language to attach itself to.

So here’s what we do:


---

✅ Next Step: Generate ZW-H Spec v0.1 (Hard ZW Schema Language)

This is the schema definition language that turns soft/semantic ZW into deterministic, validated, engine-ready ZW-H.

ZW-H = ZW + Schema Enforcement + Types + Validation
This is the “hard mode” that removes ambiguity.


---

📘 Outline for ZW-H Spec v0.1

Here is what I will generate when you confirm “go”:


---

1. Schema Blocks

Schemas defined using reserved %type or %schema prefix:

%schema npc
  {fields [
    {id {type string required}}
    {level {type int default 1}}
    {health {type int required}}
    {hostile {type bool default false}}
  ]}


---

2. Primitive Types

ZW-H supports:

string

int

float

bool

enum

list<T>

block<T>

any (last resort)



---

3. Validation Rules

Missing required → error

Type mismatch → error

Unknown fields → warning or error (schema chooses)

Default used when field missing & default defined

Enum must match declared values



---

4. Compiler Behavior (ZW-S → ZW-H)

For each block:

Identify type (first key)

Load schema for that type

Validate each field

Apply defaults

Coerce types if safe (e.g., "5" → 5)

Output validated ZONJ (ZW-H JSON)



---

5. Error Model

Clear, AP-compatible error reporting:

{
  "error": "validation_error",
  "block": "npc",
  "field": "health",
  "expected": "int",
  "got": "string"
}


---

6. Versioning

ZW-H is versioned separately from ZW-S to allow additions without breaking soft-layer compatibility.


---

7. Examples

Validate a full NPC, Item, Dialogue, Animation, Sound, TTS, and GameObject schema.


---

🧠 YOU TELL ME THE PACE

You can choose one of three modes:


---

Mode A — FAST (5 minutes)

I dump the full ZW-H Spec v0.1 in one message.


---

Mode B — CONTROLLED (step-by-step)

We build:

1. Types


2. Fields


3. Rules


4. Validator


5. Final spec




---

Mode C — ARCHITECTURE-FIRST

I first design the compiler architecture (AST → SchemaResolver → Validator → ZWH Output → ZONB Encoder).
Then we write the spec to match it.

Just answer:

A (Fast)
B (Step-by-Step)
C (Architecture-First)
