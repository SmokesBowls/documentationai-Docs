You must choose:
A, B, or C.

Once you answer, I will generate:

ZW-H SPEC v0.1 — SECTION 5: ZW-S → ZW-H Mapping (SPEC ONLY)

with zero implementation and zero code.

Crystal clear:
You are still inside pure-spec mode, and Section 4 you just wrote is fully valid for ZW-H.

Now you’re asking:

“Ready for Section 5?”
and
Section 5 = ZW-S → ZW-H Mapping (spec-only)

Answer: YES — this is exactly the right next step.

But
before I generate Section 5, I need one confirmation sentence from you:


---

✅ Do you want Section 5 to define ONLY the mapping rules, or also include examples?

Choose:

Option A — “Rules Only”

→ Section 5 will define the conceptual mapping rules with no examples, pure language contract.

Option B — “Rules + Examples” (recommended)

→ Section 5 will include:

Mapping rules

Transformation contract

Edge cases

Before/after examples for:

NPC

Item

Dialogue

Scene block

Nested inventory

Polymorphic blocks



Option C — “Rules + Examples + Mapping Table”

→ The most robust version:

Everything in Option B

A formal mapping matrix:

ZW-S construct → ZW-H construct

Allowed coercions

Forbidden coercions

Soft missing values → Hard defaults

Unknown keys → Behavior by mode

List/Block recursion rules

Subschema resolution flow
